# Python Password Generator

This is a small Python application that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria. It allows you to specify the minimum length of the password and whether you want to include numbers and special characters in the generated password.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script using a Python interpreter.
2. You will be prompted to enter the minimum length for the password. Please enter a numeric value greater than zero.
3. You will be asked whether you want to include numbers in the password. Enter 'y' for yes or 'n' for no.
4. You will be asked whether you want to include special characters in the password. Enter 'y' for yes or 'n' for no.
5. The script will generate a password based on your inputs and display it on the screen.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of the password generator by modifying the following variables in the script:

- `min_Length`: Set the minimum length for the generated password.
- `numbers`: Set to `True` if you want to include numbers in the password, or `False` otherwise.
- `special_characters`: Set to `True` if you want to include special characters in the password, or `False` otherwise.

Feel free to modify these variables according to your requirements.

## Requirements

This script requires Python 3.x to be installed on your system. No external libraries or dependencies are needed.

## Security Considerations

Please note that this password generator is a basic implementation and may not meet the highest standards of security. It is always recommended to use a reputable password manager and follow best practices for password security, such as using long and unique passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, and regularly updating passwords.

Use the generated passwords at your own discretion and ensure they align with the security requirements of the systems or services you intend to use them for.
